= Review guidelines for authors

Code review enhances the quality of the code and reduces the likelihood of introducing new bugs in the code base.
Reviewing code is a technical discussion, not an exam.
It is a common effort to learn from each other.

Before asking for a review, make sure your changes meet the following requirements:

* Code is readable and easy to understand.
* Code does not contain commented-out lines and deprecated comments.
* Code contains helpful comments to be used in the reference documentation.
* Variable and function names follow the naming convention.
* Commit messages are meaningful and follow the convention.
* All commits are signed off.
