= Signing off commits

Contributing to OSI projects requires agreeing to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
Contributors agree to the DCO by adding a ``Signed-off-by`` statement to the commit message.

----
Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <email@address.com>
----

If a commit does not include the ``Signed-off-by`` statement, this commit cannot be merged into the master branch.

To add a sign-off statement to a commit add ``-s`` or ``--signoff`` to the commit command:

----
git commit -m "Commit message" -s
----
