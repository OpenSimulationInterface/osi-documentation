= Guidelines for writing commit messages

Apart from a sign-off message, {THIS_STANDARD} requires commit messages to follow a specific format.
This format enables other people to understand the motivation behind your commits more easily.
OSI enforces these requirements only for commits to protected branches.
However, you should always follow these guidelines to help other people understand your commits.

Commit messages shall have the following structure:

[source]
----
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
----

Commits can have one of the following types:

fix::
Change fixes an error.
These changes usually correspond to a PATCH release.

feat::
Change introduces a new feature.
If the change is backward compatible, it corresponds to a MINOR release.
If the change is not backward compatible, it corresponds to a MAJOR release.

style::
Change affects only the style, not the meaning of the code.
Examples include white-space changes or code formatting.

build::
Change affects the building components.
Examples include changes to the CI pipeline or the project version.

The scope indicates which part of OSI is affected by the commit.
With OSI, commits can have one of the following scopes:

code::
Change affects the OSI code.

inlinedocs::
Change affects the inline documentation.

docs::
Change affects the accompanying documentation.

The description gives a concise summary of the change.
The description shall adhere to the following rules:

- Use imperative mode and present tense to indicate what happens when the change is applied.
- Do not capitalize the first letter.
- Do not end the description with a full stop.

The optional body contains information on  the motivation for the change.
This includes references to GitHub issues by ID.
GitHub uses these IDs to create links between the issues and the commit history.

The optional footer contains a note if the changes are breaking backwards compatibility.
This note starts with `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by a concise description of what this change breaks.

The following example shows a commit message meeting all requirements:

[source]
----
feat(model): Prevent empty StopTriggers

refers to #23

BREAKING CHANGES: StopTrigger can no longer be empty
