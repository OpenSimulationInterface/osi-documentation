Contributors' Guidelines
==========================

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this document is to help contributors get started with
the OSI Validation codebase.


Reporting issues
----------------

The simplest way to contribute to OSI Validation is to report issues that you may
find with the project on `github <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation>`__. Everyone can create issues.
Always make sure to search the existing issues before reporting a new one.
Issues may be created to discuss:

- `Feature requests or Ideas <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=>`_
- `Bugs <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=>`_
- `Questions <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md&title=>`_
- `Other <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/issues/new>`_

If practicable issues should be closed by a referenced pull request or commit (`here <https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords>`_ you can find keywords to close issues automatically). To help developers and maintainers we provide a `pull request template <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md>`_ which will be generated each time you create a new pull request.

See `here <https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-documentation/osi/howtocontribute.html#our-git-workflow>`_ for more on our git workflow.
