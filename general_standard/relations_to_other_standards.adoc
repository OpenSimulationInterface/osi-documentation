== Positioning of Open Simulation Interface within ASAM activities

OSI is part of the ASAM simulation standards that focus on simulation data for the automotive environment.
Next to OSI, ASAM provides other standards for the simulation domain, like OpenDRIVE, OpenSCENARIO and OpenCRG.

OpenDRIVE defines a storage format for the static description of road networks.
In combination with OpenCRG it is possible to add very detailed road surface descriptions to the road network.
OpenDRIVE and OpenCRG only contain static content.
To add dynamic content OpenSCENARIO is needed.
All three standards combined provide a scenario-driven description of traffic simulation that contains static and dynamic content.
