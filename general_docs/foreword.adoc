The Open Simulation Interface (OSI) is a specification for interfaces between models and components of a distributed simulation.
OSI has a strong focus on environmental perception of automated driving functions.

The complexity of automated driving functions increases rapidly.
Accordingly, the requirements for testing and development methods are growing too.
Testing in virtual environments allows to control and reproduce environment conditions.

To enable widespread use of driving simulators for function developers, the connection between the function-development framework and the simulation environment needs generic and standardized interfaces.
An easy and straight-forward compatibility between automated driving functions and the variety of available driving-simulation frameworks is made possible by OSI.
OSI addresses the emerging standard ISO 23150 for real sensorsâ€™ standardized communication interface.
OSI defines generic interfaces to ensure modularity, integrability, and interchangeability of the individual components.

The vision is to be able to connect any automated driving function to any driving simulator and emerging new hardware sensor generations using a standardized ISO 23150 interface.
This will simplify integration and thus significantly strengthen the accessibility and usefulness of virtual testing.
