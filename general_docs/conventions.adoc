= Conventions

== Naming Conventions

In this document, the following conventions apply:

``data types`` are given according to IEEE 754.

== Units

Unless stated otherwise, all numeric values within this specification are in SI units, for example:

* position/distance	in [m]
* angles in [rad]
* time in [s]
* speed in [m/s]

Geographic positions are stated in the unit defined by the spatial coordinate system, for example, in accordance with WGS 84 â€“ EPSG 4326.

Some data elements allow you to explicitly state the unit of a given value.
If the unit is not given or if there is no means to state the unit, SI units apply.
The following units may be used in explicit assignments:

             |metric tons         |t
|slope       |percent             |%

These optional units shall be used for purposes of signage and speed indication only.
They shall not be used as general units, for example, to define road geometry, etc.

== Modal verbs

To ensure compliance with the Open Simulation Interface standard, users need to be able to distinguish between mandatory requirements, recommendations, permissions, as well as possibilities and capabilities.

The following rules for using modal verbs apply:
